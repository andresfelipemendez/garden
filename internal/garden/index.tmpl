            <p>Hi, I'm Andres, a software engineer. You can find more about me on <a href="https://andresfelipemendez.com">my website</a>.</p>
            <p>This is my digital garden. It's a collection of notes, ideas, and thoughts that grow and evolve over time. Unlike a blog, these aren't polished articles, just working notes for myself. They're interconnected, often incomplete, and always changing.</p>
            <p>Since I started using AI to code, I've felt more anxious about my own understanding. So I decided to take note-taking seriously. Writing is the work. Gaining knowledge matters more than ever, and these notes are how I make sure the learning stays with me.</p>
            <p>This site is open source. The static site generator is written in Go with automated deployments via GitHub Actions and <a href="https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/cluster-config">ArgoCD</a>. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/andresfelipemendez/garden">source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
